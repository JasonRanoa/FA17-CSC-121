CHAPTER 13 Advanced File I/O Operations
Continuation on Binary Files

---

Working with structure data and files.

TERM: 	Record
		-	Structure data are saved in this format.
		-	This is one real life entity.
			For example, a Person entity.
		- 	This technically contains fields.

IRL, records might reach in the number of millions.
Using text files for this can cause slowness.
When dealing with data on that scale,
	it is convention to use BINARY FILES.

	Why? For a number of reasons.
		-	Reading and writing binary files does not need conversion
			to and from encoding schemes such as ASCII.
		-	Binary files allow raw input of data, which bypasses the
			operating system's writing methods.

	Trivia.
		The biggest database company is Oracle.
		Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, started with
			binary files and binary trees.

When working with binary files,
these three operations must be available.

	1. 	Read
	2. 	Write
	3.	Edit / Update

For structures and binary files,
take a look at Program 13-19.

	Accompanying File: invtry.dat

Apparently, this program is a functioning (sort of) database.
