CSC 121 001 Computer Science I
Day 1. August 22 Tuesday.

Important Points:
1.  Unreal Engine and Game Programming
    This program can be used to develop games in C++ code. We're working towards in the course.

2.  Visual Studio Community 15 for Windows
    This is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we will use for all coding in the course.
    While there seems to be a parallel for Mac OSX, the instructor said that I have to figure things out by myself.

3.  Basic File Structure for Programs.
    In all of the programming in this course, there will be at least 3 files.

    (1)   main.cpp
          This file contains the code that will be executed. It should only contain one function, main(). The object instances and such should be included in the said function.

    (2)   ClassName.h
          This header file would contain the class definitions.
          In C++, class definitions only include (as of this lesson) the names and scope of the properties and functions.
          Example provided in the same folder: HelloWorld.h

    (3)	  ClassName.cpp
          This file should contain the class implementation. i.e. function definitions.
