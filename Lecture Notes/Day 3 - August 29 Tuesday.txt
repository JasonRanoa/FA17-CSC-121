Static Casting
Changing the data type of the referenced variable explicitly.

Syntax: static_cast<data_type>(value)

e.g.    Casting int as double in a division.
        ---
        int a, b;
        a = 5;
        b = 2;

        // This command prints out 2.
        cout << a / b << endl;

        // This command prints out 2.5.
        cout << static_cast<double>a / b;
        ---

---

Overflow and Underflow
These is something we need to be aware of when doing scientific calculations.

---

Debugging in Visual Studio.
You can insert breakpoints in Visual Studio and look at what the value of the variables are.

---

The cin object.

The string extraction operator (>>) is used together with cin()

---

System.pause();

---

To get a line (i.e. a string until the new line character),
use getline().

It has two arguments.
    (1) The input stream. (e.g. cin)
    (2) The string variable to store it in.

e.g. getline(cin, name);
