Object Composition
Project in Use: Program 7-11.

	This is where a class is has a member that is an instance on another class.
	For example, there are two classes: Carpet and Rectangle.

	class Rectangle {
	private:
		double width, length;
	public:
		// accessors and mutators
	};

	class Carpet {
	private:
		double pricePerYd;
		Rectangle size;				// Object Composition Here.
	// More functions below.
	}

---

INLINE CODE
This is where function implementation is included in the class header / definition file.

	For example, the getters and setters are usually included inline.
	class Thing {

	private:
		double x;

	public:
		// This is inline code. Accessor.
		double getX() {
			return x;
		}
		// This in inline code. Accessor.
		void setX(double tempX) {
			x = tempX;
		}
	};

---

NOTE	There are things called INCLUDE GUARDs.
		The preprocessor director, #include, copies all the text in the referenced file and pastes it in the file.

		However, there might be problems when there are multiple #include directives in the file as classes CANNOT be declared more than once.

		For that, use INCLUDE GUARDs.
		These are a set of preprocessor directives that ensure that no class is declared more than once.

			Syntax:
				#ifndef CLASS_NAME_H
				#define CLASS_NAME_H

				// Class Declaration

				#endif // CLASS_NAME_H

			Naming Conventions:
			#ifndef directive means "If not defined...".
			It should always be paired with the #endif directive.
				Also, for readability's sake, add a comment after #end_if containing CLASS_NAME_H.

		This is standard and every include header file should have this.

STRUCTURES. Section 7-14.
Let us create a record with various data types.

These are old-fashioned and has vanished in modern usage. However, for backwards compatibility, structs can still be used.

	Syntax:
	struct StructName {
		// Variable declarations
	};

	Note that you can also include a constructor to a struct.
	Syntax:
	struct StructName {
		// Variable declarations
		StructName() {
			// do this.
		}
	}

	To use this, use it as if it's just another data type.
	And use dot notation to access struct members.
	Also, struct members are PUBLIC by default.

---

Enumeration Data Types with
enum class declarations.

Note that enum class declarations should be outside the scope where they'll be used.

For example, this is valid.
enum class Days { MON, TUE, WED };
int main() {
	Days d = Days::MON;
}

Lecture Notes on Program 7-17.
Home Software Class Company OOP Case Study

NOTE that the requirement is that to create a class, not a program.
The user of the class should be the main.cpp and what we make should be made outside of it.

In the interest rate requirement, we must know the following things:
1. Interest Formula (whether it's simple, compound, or continuous compound)
2. Interest Rate
(Typically, this is what happens.)

NOTE that there are also URL calls for C++ that allow a program to download a webpage in text format. To extract data from it, the program would have to parse the page first.

NOTE
After definition of private variables, do the public documentation.
This will include all public variables and methods and only that.
	Things to include: arguments, description
	Things NOT to include: how the method works inside

This should be designed to be released at a public site like an online website.

NOTE
The four functions defined in main.cpp are helper functions.
There are OUTSIDE of the scope of the project.
