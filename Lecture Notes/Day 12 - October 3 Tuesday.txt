Range-Based For Loops
Program 8-9.

Syntax: 	for (dataType val : arrayName) { .. }
			wherein dataType is the data type of the array,
					val is the variable for the array member, and
					arrayName is the name of the array.

This thing uses an iterator (val) and iterates over an array (arrayName).
This kind of command is popular in Java and C++'s Standard Template Library.

String Processing
C++ strings are character arrays, so it is possible to iterate through all of them.

Example Code:
	int is[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	string word = "Doge.";

	for (char s : word) {
		cout << s << endl;
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
		cout << word[i] << endl;
	}

Vectors

Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of programmer defined data types and algorithms that are available to C++ out of the box.
The vector data type is in STL.

This is similar to a one-dimensional array, but better.
It is superior because:
	1. 	The size doesn't have to be declared at compile time.
	2. 	There's a whole lot of methods that come with it.
		e.g. Switch last element with the first.

For example: Program 8-24.

To use vectors, include the <vector> standard library.
Syntax:		vector <dataType> varName (arguments)
			wherein the dataType is the data type of the members,
					varName is the name of the vector, and
					arguments are optional.

Chapter 9
Searching and Sorting Algorithms

---

Search Algorithms
A method of locating a specific item in a collection of data.

We discuss three searching algorithms in this class.
Here are they.
	1. 	Linear Search
		wherein each member is being tested sequentially.
		This is the simplest search algorithm.
